
In order to improve the ERJ 145's maintainability the team attempted to focus on: decrease the time expended to repair systems and to realize inspections; increase the time between inspections and the number of person and skill to operate and maintain an aircraft. Also focus on improve the efficiency fault-isolation capability to release airplane for flight sooner.

It was considered expended time for tasks, technicians quantity, skill level required to operate and maintain the airplane, robustness, proved maturity, standardization, reuse, easy acquisition, communality, simplicity, reliability, reparability, troubleshooting, dispatchability and availability.

The team tried attacks all possibilities of DMC reduction and studied those which show greater potential. The next figure shows the mind map of the possibilities of DMC reduction which is based in the characteristics above.
