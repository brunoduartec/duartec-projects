As discussed, the modifications the electrical team decided to do were the APU Starter / Generator and GCU, the Static Inverter and the Ni-Cd Batteries, all these alongside with the wiring refit. This chapter intends to show a resume of all the results of costs for each of these modifications, making it easier to understand the role the electrical team played on the whole project. The following table displays the results.
