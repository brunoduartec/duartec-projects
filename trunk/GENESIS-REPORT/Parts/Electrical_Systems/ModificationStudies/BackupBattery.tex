% 10.2.4 - Backup Battery
During the Conceptual Studies phase, it was verified that the backup batteries (model Jet PS-835D) were not passing the scheduled checks and thus requiring its replacement. It was observed that the cell pack has an intrinsic lower MTBF compared to other components of the battery, and the change for another supplier can reduce the number of unscheduled removals. To verify if the replacement of the backup battery can reduce the DMC, it was considered a growth of 30 \% in the MTBUR.

The main function of the backup battery is provide stabilized power for operation of the GCUs. During electrical emergency, the backup battery supplies power to the following loads, through the backup hot bus: APU generation, DC distribution, DC generation (1, 2, 3 and 4), and ISIS (Integrated Standby Instrument System, for the ERJ 145 XR). These loads have a consumption of approximately 3.5 A, and must be sustained during at least 40 minutes. Some replacement batteries are available for the Jet PS-835D: Concorde RG-1835 and Securaplane XL244. These batteries have a lower capacity (3.5 Ah and 4 Ah, respectively) and, despite they can provide enough power for the essential loads connected to the backup hot bus, an analysis showed that this modification is not worth after 10 years of operation, resulting in a loss of US\$ 1,400.00. For this reason, the backup battery will not change.
