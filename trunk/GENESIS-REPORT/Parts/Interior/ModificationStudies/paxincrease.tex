% 5.2.1 - PAX Increase
Increasing the number of passenger is one of the main modifications and to achieve that, it is necessary to change the LOPA (Layout of Passenger Arrangement) and the aircraft's structure. To decide the size of the fuselage, considering the replacement of the seat by one of 29" instead of the 31" standard seat, considering the choice among insert the fuselage in front of or behind the emergency exit, considering that to avoid the airplane stability getting worst the weight increase must happen below the CG and to reduce the drag and weight impact the fuselage increase must be as shorter as it can. Considering all this factors, a fuselage ring of 1.06 m (41.7 inches), the minimum necessary to accommodate 2 more row of seats, was chosen.


The reduction in the pitch size also reduces the comfort comparing to the original pitch size, therefore the aircraft's seats must also be modified. After performing some research about the current ERJ-145 operation, the seats are comfortable and there isn't any complaint about the pitch size. This information brings the opportunity to change this pitch size.

The new seat chosen is the new generation of Embraer's seats, under its specification and developed by C\&D with some minors changes discussed in the Seat section galley.\\

\textbf{LOPA (RI1-I1)}
\\

To determine the LOPA there are some preview considerations that must be taken in account.

In every configuration of the 145, there are 6 galley distribution

\caption{Galleys distribuctions}
\label{fig:galleysdistribuction}
\end{figure}

As the study shown in the galley section, the number of galleys can be reduced, so the space occupied can be used to place new seats, as shown in the image \ref{fig:frontlopa}


\begin{figure}[H] % Example image
\center{\includegraphics[width=300px]{Pictures/Interior/front_lopa_seats.eps}}
\caption{Front LOPA new arrangement}
\label{fig:frontlopa}
\end{figure}

In the region in front of the service door there is a double seat with VLAUS inches of pitch.To check if the seats would be comfortable, and if the galleys can be properly used, that section was built at the mockup, and some tests were made and recorded as pictures and video, showing how the passengers would feel, and how the flight atendants would use the galleys. These tests are best described in the mockup section.
The figure \ref{fig:LOPA} shows the LOPA, emphasizing the regions where new passengers were added.

\begin{itemize}
  \item 6 below the windows
  \item 2 in front of the service door
  \item 2 in front of the passenger door
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H] % Example image
\center{\includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{Pictures/Interior/LOPA.eps}}
\caption{LOPA configuration}
\label{fig:LOPA}
\end{figure}

Increasing the pax number, the amount of overhead bins was increased to keep the same internal volume per passenger as it is now, conserving the same autonomy to the passenger.In the new ring of fuselage, there will be Overhead bins for the extra passengers in that area. Also, new oberhead bins will be placed in the area of the two new seats in the front of the service door. Hence, the capability of hand lugage for each passenger will not be reduced.


\textbf{Seat (RI1-I2)}
\\
To be possible to increase the number of passengers, it is necessary to change the aircraft's LOPA. Besides resizing the galley, reducing the size of pitch from 31 inches to 29 inches is also needed to achieve the project's goal. One concern the fact that decreasing the pitch can also bring discomfort to the passengers, so the solution was the choice for a new seat that provides an enjoyable experience for the passengers even reducing the pitch size.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=200px]{Pictures/Interior/SlimSeat_Isometric.eps}}
\caption{Galleys distribuctions}
\label{fig:slimseatisometric}
\end{figure}

The C\&D Zodiac, under Embraer's specification, has developed a new seat, known as Slim Seat, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:slimseatisometric} and Figure \ref{fig:slimseatside}, which has certain characteristics what matters to the EMB-145's modernization, such as 2.5 kg less in each dual seat configuration in comparison to the original version, called Elite, which have 24 kg.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=200px]{Pictures/Interior/SlimSeat_Side.eps}}
\caption{Galleys distribuctions}
\label{fig:slimseatside}
\end{figure}

The Slim Seat was initially developed for the ERJ-190's aircraft family, so some changes are necessary to proper compatibility with the EMB-145. These changes are summarized in reducing the width of the seat and the side rail's fixation. Fortunately, all these modifications have been made and, therefore, it is not necessary to redesign these seats.


Another important feature is that the new design allow to transmit an actual pitch's size one more inch bigger than the real pitch's size, so the 29 inches pitch chose indeed seems as a 30 inches pitch. The Figure \ref{fig:slimelitecomparison} illustrates the comparison between the original seat and new one. As can be seen, there is no big difference in the passenger's space. Also, the mockup bilt was used to make some tests os the pich and seat sizes, and confirm the choice. These tests are best described at the mockup section. '

\textbf{Oxygen Masks (RI1-L1)}

By regulation the number of oxygen masks must exceed in 10 percent the number of seats, so in the new airplane configuration its number must be increased by 6 to reach the number of 66 oxygen masks without counting the passenger oxygen adds.
For those we must add the extra masks:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 3 triple masks distributed homogeneously in the cabin
  \item 1 on the toilet
  \item 2 to the flight attendant
\end{itemize}
