In the galley there is space to store just one trolley. Thus, was necessary to create other compartment on the forward right side of cabin for to store this another trolley. In this compartment there will be space for store some clothes, one half trolley and some avionics boxes. This compartment will facilitate the maintenance of avionics devices in electronic bay, because will allow access to electronics through one removable door on front passenger seat, as shown in figure \ref{fig:MFS1}, and through of racks that can be pulled for pick up electronic equipments like the hardware of TCAS or of GPS, as shown in figure \ref{fig:MFS2}.  As it can seen in figure \ref{fig:MFS1}, this compartment is composed by one superior space that works like a wardrobe, and one inferior space for store the half trolley. The inferior space has one false back wall that can be disconnected for to access the avionics boxes through of racks, as can seen in figure 05.
