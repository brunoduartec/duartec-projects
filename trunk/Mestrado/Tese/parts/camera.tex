Nowaday cameras have problems of distortion that can be treated because there are constant distortions and calibrations issues.

Radial distortion as "barrel" or "fish-eye" effect

barrel

Barrel lens distortion is an effect associated with wide-angle lenses and, in particular, zoom wide-angles. This effect causes images to be spherized, which means the edges of images look curved and bowed to the human eye. It almost appears as though the photo image has been wrapped around a curved surface.

Tangential Distortion
