Due to the add of winglets and due to the fuselage stretch some structural analysis were necessary to be made in the modified aircraft. The main objectives of those analysis is to determine the necessary modifications on the existing aircraft and to preview if those modifications are able to be done.

The analysis will not be very specific, it will be just an overview to determine the main consequences of the structural reinforcements. The study is done using only simple calculus and it is based on the existing reports and drawings of the ERJ-145. Although the final results does not have an extraordinary precision, it will give the group a guideline for the next step of the project.
