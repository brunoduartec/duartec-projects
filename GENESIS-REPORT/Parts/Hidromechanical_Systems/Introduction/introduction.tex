Two types divided the modifications on the hydro-mechanical systems. The first one is due to the maintenance, aiming to reduce the operational costs related to maintenance. The second is targeting to satisfy the need to stretch the airplane, looking to increase the revenue per flight.

These modifications were previously listed in the Conceptual Phase of this project. For the Preliminary Phase, it is intended to do deeper study of the modifications proposed. This chapter is divided by the reason of each modification (Maintenance driven modification or Revenue increment driven modification), the sub-system (Flight Command, Hydro-mechanics and Landing Gear) and finally by the specification of the modification (or service bulletin). The second chapter lists the costs associated with the modifications and in the last one there is a conclusion.
