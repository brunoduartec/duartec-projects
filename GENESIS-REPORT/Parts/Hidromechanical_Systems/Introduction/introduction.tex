Two types divided the modifications on the hydro-mechanical systems. The first one was a demand passed by the maintenance group aiming reduce the operational costs related to maintenance. The second was to satisfy the need to stretch the airplane from the interiors group looking to increase the revenue per flight.

These modifications were previously listed in the Conceptual Phase of this project. In this phase, it is intended to do a more complete study of the modifications proposed. This chapter is divided by the reason of the modification (Maintenance driven modification, Revenue increment driven modification), the sub-system (Flight Command, Hydro-mechanics, Landing Gear) and finally by the specification of the modification (or service bulletin). A second chapter will list the costs associated with the modifications and the last one will be a conclusion.
