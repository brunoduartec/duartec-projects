The spoiler control unit (SCU) is an important component with all the functions related to the spoiler control system like speed break and ground spoiler, the SCU is compound by a relay system circuit board and the connector and lay-out are segregated through all the unit.

The main function of the SCU is to receive a lot of signal and define the ground spoiler and speed break logic operation. These signals are come from thrust lever position, landing gear shock absorber (air/ground), wheel speed, engine condition (N2), flap position and speed break lever. The speed break and/or ground spoiler are energized from SCU when the operation condition is achieved.

To avoid the dormant failure the SCU also monitors the duplicated signals. The Spoiler System incorporates a maint/test switch, installed in the maintenance panel, behind the pilot seat.

The SCU is compound of four segregated electrical circuits, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ground spoiler function circuit - outboard spoiler
    \item ground spoiler function circuit - inboard spoilers
    \item speed brake function circuit (including automatic pitch trim function)
    \item spoiler position indication circuit
\end{itemize}

The SCU has four circuit breakers; one for each spoiler circuit, the main purpose of the circuit breakers is to protect the system from over-current.
The most common failure mode that happens with SCU is the low current which pass through the relays at the spoiler system indication, this effect cause the appearance of a colorless glaze in the relay contact so called tarnishing (the relay electrical contact degradation), this problem causes an intermittent failure.

This failure mode can be fixed applying the Service Bulletin number 145-27-0121, this SB suggests the installation of a pull-up resistors (560 $\Omega$) in the relay line, the main purpose of this change is to drain the current, so in this way the current that pass through the relay electrical contact increases avoiding the tarnishing formation and improving the reliability of the system, in short the pull-up resistor works like a current drives and a diode in the circuit lines creates an interface with the DAU (Data Acquisition Unit).
