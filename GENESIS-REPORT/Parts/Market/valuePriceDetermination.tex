After the Market case analysis, can be assumed that the value of the modernization package can be at max  \$ 3,300,000.00 to be interesting to the clients.

Thus, the price can't be more than \$ 3,300,000.00 and not lower than the project cost.

The project cost has two prices, one for the clients that have the residual value contract and one for those that haven't (the markups vary).

The price determination was done in the financial analysis and the prices established were:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clients with the contract = \$ 2,142,705.85
  \item Clients without the contract = \$ 2,903,017.02 
\end{itemize}
