The recently aircraft orders and scope clauses change is making the market favorable to aircrafts with 76 seats in the USA. This way, the main competitors considered were the E175 and CRJ900 for american and european companies, the CRJ200 for companies that already operate both airplanes (in a case that the company choose one of them to retain in the fleet), the ATR72 for european companies (as Europe has a higher acceptance to turboprops) and the ATR42 and CRJ200 for New Operator.
