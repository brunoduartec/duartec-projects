% 6.6 - Aeronautics Costs Sumary
The evaluation of the cost of the aeronautics modifications mentioned before was based on a critical analysis on previous EMBRAER projects, technical reunions and technical visits.
It's important to emphasize that is hard to segregate the aeronautics costs from structural costs due to the high interchangeability between those two technologies. That said, this cost summary includes both of aeronautics and structures costs.
