The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of ERJ 145 is a Hamilton Sundstrand (today is Pratt & Whitney AeroPower's) APS 500R APU, and is a "gas turbine engine used during ground operations, to provide electricity, compressed air, shaft power to engine start, air conditioning, electric power and other aircraft systems. Can also provide back up electric power during flight operation".
Considerations about APU replacement were made, however, recurrent and non recurrent costs would be very high to no significant effects on CASM and in the efficiency of the main engine in the ground, thus, this modification was not considered.
