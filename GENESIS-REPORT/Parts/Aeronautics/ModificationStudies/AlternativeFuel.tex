Among the modifications studies made, one of them were alternative fuels. Nowadays, there are two major lines of study  about alternative fuels. One of them involves Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) \cite{Wald} and the utilization of the fuel in his real state, and transported in cryogenic state, or converted in liquid jet fuel kerosene. The other line studies hydrogen, also to be transported in cryogenic state. However, these studies are preliminary and have low Technology Readiness Level and maturity. The implementation of these technologies are expected to operate after 2020, being impracticable to be used in this project, due to the urgency of the solutions.
