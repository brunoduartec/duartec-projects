Considering the analysis previously made, it can be seen that, in the case of the client, the NPV of the modernization package is greater than if the client keeps the aircraft without modernization. In the company's case, the NPV is greater than zero. In both cases the IRR is greater than the market rate of return.

The payback times are considerated highly acceptable for clients (5 months) as far for  Embraer (4 years).

Both modernization package prices (with residual value warranty or without it) fit perfectly between the intervals determined by the market studies.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the project is considered viable both for the client and for the company.
