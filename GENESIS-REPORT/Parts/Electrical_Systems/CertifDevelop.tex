To validate the electrical modifications the following certification tests should be performed, and each modification will have the subsequent man-hour cost.

Exchanging the batteries: (250:00 hours)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Energization with battery 1
    \item Energization with battery 2
    \item Backup battery system
    \item Dc bus 1 short circuit
    \item Dc bus 2 short circuit
    \item Central dc bus short circuit
    \item Essential dc bus 1 short circuit
    \item Backup dc bus1 short circuit
    \item Backup essential dc bus short circuit
\end{enumerate}

Exchanging the APU Generator: (350:00 hours)	

\begin{enumerate}
\item APU generator capacity
\item Transient limits and stability APU starter/generator
\item Voltage regulation /ripple APU starter/generator
\item Feeder fault protection
\item Starter/generator reverse current protection
\item Starter/generator overvoltage protection
\item Overexcitation
\item Equalization
\end{enumerate}

Exchanging the static inverter: (80:00 hours)


\begin{enumerate}
 \item THD (total harmonic distortion)
\item Overload
\item Overvoltage
\item Undervoltage
\item Crest factor
\item Short circuit
\end{enumerate}

The test rig used before to validate the ERJ-145 family was disassembled, so a new RIG is necessary. Building this test rig results some additional costs, estimated below.

\begin{itemize}
 \item This quotation does not include instrumentation.
 \item  It is considered that the main component tested was the starter/generator, therefore, all the RIG construction costs will be paid by this modification. And the other three modifications will cost an additional US\$ 5,000.00 each to buy the components for the RIG.
\end{itemize}

A flight test should be performed at ISA+35 to assure that the starter/generator is well refrigerated during cruise. Since it is too hard to reach ISA+35, the test is performed at different other temperatures and, furthermore, the acquisition data is extrapolated to 50 $\degree$C.
