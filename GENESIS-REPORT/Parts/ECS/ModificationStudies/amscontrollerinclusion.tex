All changes designed for ECS improvement require a higher level of signal processing in order to control the subsystems, witch the current ERJ-145 configuration doesn't have. So to make this planned modifications possible, a central processor inclusion is needed. There all the control logic, to control the Rain and Ice Protection subsystem, Bleed Temperature Control and Cabin Temperature control, will be made.

A LRU (Line Replaceable Unit) will concentrate all logical processing of ECS, such as the pressure and temperature control loop to Rain and Ice Protection and Bleed subsystem respectively. It will also drive the air conditioning packs and bleed leak monitoring subsystem. This LRU will be installed in the electronic bay located behind the galley in forward cabin. This way, this will help the center of gravidity position and the electric cables will be shorter, because of the proximity to Environmental System equipments.
