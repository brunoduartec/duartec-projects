As is known the ECS (Environmental Control System) has a great impact in operational cost of any aircraft  nowadays, both in fuel consumption, due to the air quantity that is bled from engines, and in maintenance due to the equipments and subsystems reliability.

The modifications on the ERJ-145 Environmental Control System are focused in the two main points that Genesis Team has concentrated its work in order to minimize the operational cost, Fuel Consumption and Maintenance.

In the following sections the modifications, planned to meet the high level
requirements to reduce the consumption and maintenance costs, and that were thought the Conceptual
Studies phase, to make the aircraft under study more attractive in its market, will be explained.
